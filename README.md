Business Forecasting - Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Household Energy Consumption
----------------

OThe consumption in the residential sector represents a significant percentage in the total electricity demand all over the world and it is expected to grow. The biggest concern of power system operators is to maintain the balance between generation and load. So, the prediction of energy consumption becomes a key component in the management (e.g. power flow) of the electrical grid.

Neural Network Models used are Simple RNN and LSTM.

Simple RNN model with a R-Squared Score of about 85% is able to forecast much better on the out-of-sample data compared to the LSTM model. Thus, for this example, Simple RNN model proved to be quite accurate at predicting fluctuations in electricity consumption.
